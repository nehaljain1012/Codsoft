# Codsoft
Welcome to my CodSoft Machine Learning Internship repository! Here, I document the progress and projects completed during my internship journey. This repository showcases my hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets under the guidance of CodSoft.

# About
This repository is a collection of projects and tasks undertaken as part of my machine learning internship at CodSoft. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation using Python and various machine learning libraries.

# Tools and Techniques
I've utilized essential tools such as Python, along with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms. Projects may include techniques such as TF-IDF for text analysis, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM for classification tasks.

# Goals
Through this repository, I aim to showcase my growth in machine learning skills, contribute to practical applications in data science, and learn from feedback and collaboration within the community.

# Contact
Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions, feedback, or opportunities for collaboration!
